FEATURES					*singleton-features*

This plugin provides the following features.

1. Avoid starting with multiple Vim instances.
When you start Vim with one or more files, and remote Vim has already started,
this plugin opens the files by the existing Vim, and exits immediately.

2. Diff mode support.
If you start Vim by |vimdiff| or with |-d| option, this plugin opens the files
by diff mode by an existing Vim.

3. Stdin(|--|) support.
When stdin is supplied to Vim, the data is sent to an existing Vim.

4. Remote edit support.
When a file that matches to specified pattern(|g:singleton#entrust_pattern|)
was passed, this plugin opens the file by an existing Vim, and wait.  The edit
has finished and the buffer is closed, the first Vim is terminate.
